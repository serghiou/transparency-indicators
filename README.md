# Machine-driven assessment of transparency across the biomedical literature: how open is open?

<div align='justify'>
  
All relevant raw data is available on OSF at doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/E58WS under a GPL3 license.

### How do I run the code?

First, fork the GitHub repo onto your Desktop. Then, download the data from OSF such that you maintain the same folder structure as already present on OSF. Make sure that your computer runs the latest version of R and RStudio. Install the [rtransparent](https://github.com/serghiou/rtransparent) package by running `devtools::install_github('serghiou/rtransparent)`. You should be able to run the code - if not, please send an email to stelios.serghiou@gmail.com to let me know!

### How is the repo structured?

The repo is structured across 4 sub-sections in the order that they were done: the manual adjudication subsection, the development of the tool (this code is found in the [rtransparent](https://github.com/serghiou/rtransparent) repo), the evaluation of the tool and the use of the tool to assess all open access articles on PubMed Central. Each subsection is subdivided into 3 directories. The data directory contains all data, the code directory contains all code and the output directory contains all output.

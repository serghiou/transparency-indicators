## Meetings

### Teleconference Stelios-Despina

SciTech Project Strategic Planning

1. Re accessing the pdfs: Stelios has extracted 210 pdfs from the 1000 articles in the MasterList, that were on Open Access Journals

    a. R code (copy to be sent to Despina)
    b. Of note, among the first 500 in the MasterList 188 were OpenAccess and 312 were not and should be downloaded in a Separate way

                A. Option 1: Code
                B. Option 2: Ask Lane Library for access to the Lane Library Server with these pdfs (that are available only to Stanford Community-through the Lane Library) and code to automatically download them
                C. Option 3: Manual download the pdfs of these 312 articles (half Despina and Half Stelios)

2. Re Storage/Sharing of pdfs: The 210 pdfs will be shared in a DropBox folder

    a. Each file will be labeled by the ID (001, 002, etc)-PMCID-PMID
    b. Sorting can be done according to the ID

3. Re paper eligibility: Stelios already extracted in an Excel the PubMed Information for all 1000 papers in the MasterList

    a. Publication type
    b. Funding
    c. MeSH terms etc

                A. Despina will review the list and identify articles that should be excluded (editorials, view points, reviews, case series, case reports, SR/ma, cost-effectiveness analyses etc)
                B. Will generate a list of IDs to be excluded

4. Re Data Extraction Form (DEF):

a. We will use an DEF Excel spreadsheet that includes information as that extracted by Josh in his paper in Table 3 in page 9
    b. Suggest : 1) To highlight in the pdf the area where the info was found  AND 2) To copy pate the info in a column in the DEF spreadsheet, next to the Virtue Indicator information (e.g. next to the COI column, we will add a column with the exact statement from the pdf).

5. Re Prioritization of Data Extraction:

    a. The following Virtue Indicators, are the Indicators that can be easily extracted from the pdfs

        A. Funding (no mention, no funding, public, private, other, some combination of Public, Private, Other)
        B. COI (No tatement, Statement, No conflict exists, Statement, Conflict exists)
        C. Protocol availability (full protocol, no protocol)
        D. Data availability (Some data sharing, No data sharing)
        E. Replication (Novel finding, Replication, Novel Finding AND Replication, No statement on Novelty or Replication)

6. The following  Virtue Indicator need access to Web of Knowledge

        a. Citing article= Replication of the Index Study
        b. Citing article= Systematic Review/Meta-analysis with Data Included from the Index Study
        c. HEADS UP: Very few articles in the 2015-2017 list of these random 500 articles are expected to have citations anyway
        d. PLAN: Stelios can generate a code to automatically identify in Web of Knowledge those Index articles (among our 500 eligible articles) that have Citations, that will need to be further screened for (i) or (ii) (see above)

7. Re Timeline for Deliverables:

a. It appears that Stanford has Deliverables for “Virtuous Measures” for Nov 17, Dec 17 and January 18.
        b. Will plan for Nov 17, at least for the first 210 pdfs that we already have
        c. Will check with JPAI, when the full 500 should be Delivered

8. Re contacting Josh:

        a. We will try first ourselves
        b. We may consider contacting Josh for outcome #4: (Replication Evidence in Articles Citing the Index Article), if the number of articles with Citations and number of Citations are large

9. TO SUMMARIZE THE PLAN AS OF 10/17/2018

    a. For Stelios

        A. To send to Despina the Excel with PubMed Extracted information for the 1000 papers
        B. To create a Data Extraction Form (DEF) that would be used for recording the “Virtue Indicators” from the 500 screened eligible papers
        C. To meet with Lane Library, if the Non Open Access Journals can be automatically accessed. Can meet with DCI if needed
        D. By  ~Sunday 10/21 to check if 312 non open access journal papers can be automatically downloaded OR not (if Not, we will need to download them manually)
        E. To share the 210 pdfs in DropBox with Despina
        F. To number the pdfs in DropBox with ID (001)-PMCID-PMID
        G. Will start Pilot  Data extraction from 20 papers (the first 20 ordered numerically in the DropBox) for the Virtue Indicators that can be extracted by Full Text review (except for the Citations) and compare with DCI results

    b. For Despina

        A. Will check with JPAI the following questions
  i. Question #1: Can we keep these 354 pdfs and just download manually additional 146 papers in non open access journals?
            ii. Question #2: For those that are NOT available in Lane Library and have to be ordered for $5 per article, (sometimes) can we just exclude them, and include only 146 papers that are immediately available in Lane Library?

        B. Will Review the Excel with PubMed Extracted Information and Identify those papers (among the 1000) that should be excluded
        C. Will start Pilot  Data extraction from 20 papers (the first 20 ordered numerically in the DropBox) for the Virtue Indicators that can be extracted by Full Text review (except for the Citations) and compare with SS results
